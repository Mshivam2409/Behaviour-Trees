# Behaviour Tree

The main goal of this project is to create a Behavior Tree implementation that uses the principles of Model Driven Development to separate the role of the Component Developer from the Behavior Designer.

In practice, this means that:

Custom TreeNodes must be reusable building blocks. We should be able to implement them once and reuse them to build many behaviors.

To build a Behavior Tree out of TreeNodes, the Behavior Designer must not need to read nor modify the source code of a given TreeNode.
